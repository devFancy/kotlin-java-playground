# Java Spring Boot Practice (Multi-Module)

This project is not meant to be a perfect design.
It is a basic structure for practicing and learning how to build Spring Boot projects in a better way.

I started this project because Iâ€™m interested in clean and sustainable software design.
I was inspired by the [spring-boot-java-template](https://github.com/team-dodn/spring-boot-java-template) and wanted to create my own version for learning.


# Project Information

It connects to other modules in the project.

## Reference

Special thanks to [geminiKim](https://github.com/geminiKim) for the original [spring-boot-java-template](https://github.com/team-dodn/spring-boot-java-template), which inspired the creation of this project.

If you'd like to check the latest versions of Kotlin, Spring Boot, or additional resources, I recommend visiting the spring-boot-kotlin-template repository.
